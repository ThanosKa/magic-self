Create a plan for the given feature. Do not write code—produce actionable tasks.

## Planning Rules

- Break features into small, implementable tasks.
- Sample code/pseudocode is allowed for complex logic.
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear.
- Skip testing tasks unless explicitly requested.
- Store plans in `.md` when requested.

## Plan Quality

- Reference specific files/functions to change.
- Each task should be clear and implementable without ambiguity.
- Avoid placeholders or “figure out later” items.
- Match plan complexity to request complexity.

Refer to `.cursor/rules/` for coding conventions when including code examples.
